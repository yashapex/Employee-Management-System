Tech Stack: React.js | Context API | JavaScript | CSS | HTML

Key Highlights:

🔐 Context‑Driven Authentication
– Built a custom AuthProvider.jsx using React Context to manage user sessions and role‑based access (Admin vs. Employee).

🖥️ Dynamic Login Experience
– Created a sleek Login.jsx with email/password validation, “show‑password” toggle (FontAwesome eye/eye‑slash), and responsive styling.

✏️ Intuitive Task Creation
– Developed CreateTask.jsx form to assign tasks on the fly—complete with title, description, due date, assignee, and category inputs.

📊 Live Task Dashboard
– Dashboard components (AdminDashboard.jsx, EmployeeDashboard.jsx) render real‑time task counts and filter views for New, Active, Completed, and Failed tasks.

🗃️ Local‑Storage‑Backed Data
– Simulated persistence using setLocalStorage() / getLocalStorage() utilities to seed and update employees & tasks without a backend.

🎨 UI/UX Polish
– Tailwind‑powered layouts, rounded cards, and clear feedback on form submission—ensured a modern, mobile‑friendly interface.
